# arch-monochrome (in the style of michapuza)

"My monochromatic rice for BSPWM on arch linux, complete with: Custom GTK theme, modified polybar-2 by @adi1090x (soon to be replaced with EWW (Elkowar's Wacky Widgets)) and a sexy sexy colourscheme." (-caffeine01).

You'll see my (michapuza) incremental changes appear here as I make subtle changes to fit my preferences and workflow. This project is incredible to begin with, now I'm just making it "more me."
